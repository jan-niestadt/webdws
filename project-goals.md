# Web-based XML editor

This describes the project goals. The user will update this file manually; the agent should not change it.

Goals for this project:
- a web-based XML editor
- targets non-technical users
- there must always be an XML schema
- the XML schema determines the user interface
- the document is validated against the XML schema
- if there are any schema violations, a descriptive message is shown in the UI where the invalid value or structure occurs
